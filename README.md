# Getting started: MPCDF Raven

This tutorial is written for the MPCDF Raven users from the MPI of Animal Behavior. It has been put together and is maintained by the Animal-Environment Interactions research group.
The Raven user guide can be found [here](https://docs.mpcdf.mpg.de/doc/computing/raven-user-guide.html#login)

# Step 1: Create an account #

1. Go to https://selfservice.mpcdf.mpg.de/register/antrag.php?lang=en
2. Select MPI of Animal Behavior
3. Pick one person to approve your application


# Step 2: Set up Two-factor authentication (2FA)

1. Install a 2FA app on your mobile phone (e.g. Aegis Authenticator, andOTP, FreeOTP, etc.) 
2. When using the app for the first time, read the QR code available here to connect to the cluster:

Find more info [here](https://docs.mpcdf.mpg.de/faq/2fa.html)

# Step 3: Log in #

**If on the MPI network**
(or using a VPN to connect to one. this is required for the Bücklestraße or uni Konstanz), open the terminal and type:
```sh
ssh username@raven.mpcdf.mpg.de
```
Enter your MPCDF password and then the token generated by the 2FA app on your phone.

**If not on the MPI network**, open the terminal and type:
```sh
ssh username@gate.mpcdf.mpg.de
```
Enter your MPCDF password and then the token generated by the 2FA app on your phone.

Then, ssh into Raven:
```sh
ssh username@raven.mpcdf.mpg.de
```
Enter your MPCDF password and then the token generated by the 2FA app on your phone.

# Step 4: Transfer your files #

Raven does not have access to the files on your local machine. You need to copy the files that you need for your job (e.g. input files, scripts, etc.) to your designated directory on Raven. 

### Note on file systems ###

**File System ``` /u ```**

This is your home directory ``` $HOME ```. The complete path to this directory is ```/raven/u/username/ ``` This is your default working directory when you log in to Raven and when you open R. The default disk quota in /u is 2.5 TB. The ``` /u ``` directory is where you want to copy your files to. 

**File System ``` /ptmp ```**
